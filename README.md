# Pong - Now available on Minix OS
## LCOM - 2021/22 2nd Year

## Computer Laboratory

### Description

The classic PONG game, with some twists and additions, in Minix OS. Supports Player vs Computer and Player vs Player (via serial Port). Developed in C.

During the semester, we developed drivers for the peripherals to be used in the game (Mouse, Keyboard, Timer, Real-Time Clock, Serial Port, Graphics Card).
In addition to all the well-known PONG features, we added powerups to make the game even more fun to play and challenging. Players can add walls and increase ball speed, while trying to score points to be the game winner! The game's menus change according to the time of the day, and it is possible to play with another person on another computer, communicating via Serial Port.
